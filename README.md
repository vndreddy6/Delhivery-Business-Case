# Delhivery Business Case

Delhivery, India's leading and rapidly growing integrated player, has set its sights on creating
the commerce operating system.
They achieve this by utilizing world-class infrastructure, ensuring the highest quality in
logistics operations, and harnessing cutting-edge engineering and technology capabilities.

## Goal
The company wants to understand and process the data coming out of data engineering
pipelines:
● Clean, sanitize and manipulate data to get useful features out of raw fields
● Make sense out of the raw data and help the data science team to build forecasting
models on it.

## Dataset Column Information:
1. data - tells whether the data is testing or training data
2. trip_creation_time – Timestamp of trip creation
3. route_schedule_uuid – Unique ID for a particular route schedule
4. route_type – Transportation type
a. FTL – Full Truck Load: FTL shipments get to the destination sooner, as the truck
is making no other pickups or drop-offs along the way
b. Carting: Handling system consisting of small vehicles (carts)
5. trip_uuid - Unique ID given to a particular trip (A trip may include different source and
destination centers)
6. source_center - Source ID of trip origin
7. source_name - Source Name of trip origin
8. destination_cente – Destination ID
9. destination_name – Destination Name
10. od_start_time – Trip start time
11. od_end_time – Trip end time
12. start_scan_to_end_scan – Time taken to deliver from source to destination
13. is_cutoff – Unknown field
14. cutoff_factor – Unknown field
15. cutoff_timestamp – Unknown field
16. actual_distance_to_destination – Distance in kms between source and destination
warehouse
17. actual_time – Actual time taken to complete the delivery (Cumulative)
18. osrm_time – An open-source routing engine time calculator which computes the
shortest path between points in a given map (Includes usual traffic, distance through
major and minor roads) and gives the time (Cumulative)
19. osrm_distance – An open-source routing engine which computes the shortest path
between points in a given map (Includes usual traffic, distance through major and minor
roads) (Cumulative)
20. factor – Unknown field
21. segment_actual_time – This is a segment time. Time taken by the subset of the
package delivery
22. segment_osrm_time – This is the OSRM segment time. Time taken by the subset of the
package delivery
23. segment_osrm_distance – This is the OSRM distance. Distance covered by subset of
the package delivery
24. segment_factor – Unknown field
